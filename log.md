# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 1 : July 06 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Did exploratory data analysis on [HousingPrice](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) @[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)!

**Thoughts** : I found multicollinearity in the dataset, hope I'd be able to fight this!

## Day 2 : July 07 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Explored data, solved multicollinearity to some extent and normalized it. Getting RMS error of 0.15 on test set.

**Thoughts** : Hope I'd be able to reduce error rate and submit my predictions to kaggle!
