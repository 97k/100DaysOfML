# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 06 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Did exploratory data analysis on [HousingPrice](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) @[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)!

**Thoughts** : I found multicollinearity in the dataset, hope I'd be able to fight this!
