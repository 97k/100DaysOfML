# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 1 : July 06, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Did exploratory data analysis on [HousingPrice](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) @[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)!

**Thoughts** : I found multicollinearity in the dataset, hope I'd be able to fight this!

## Day 2 : July 07, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Explored data, solved multicollinearity to some extent and normalized it. Getting RMS error of 0.15 on test set.

**Thoughts** : Hope I'd be able to reduce error rate and submit my predictions to kaggle!

## Day 4 : July 09, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Revised Linear Regression, Logsitic Regression, Bias Variance

**Thoughts** : I didn't made notes before, now I am working hard and smart!

**Link to work:** NaN

## Day 5 : July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Revised Regularization and Started exploring Unsupervised Learning...

**Thoughts** : Not productive day, hope to make the coming days count!

## Day 6 : July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress** : K-means algo with optimization objective, Data Compression(intro), PCA, Started revising Linear Algebra!

**Thoughts** : I am thinking to write a blogpost on K-means!

**Link to work:** NaN

## Day 7 : July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Started and finished writing blogpost on KMeans, studied about PCA!

**Thoughts** : I need to work on my time management skills, Wish to solve an Unsupervised learning problem on kaggle!

## Day 8 : July 13, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I was busy Crunching the resources to learn NLP, found many!

**Thoughts** : For an internship in ds/ml, I need to do some portfolio projects! After NLP I'll put all in for spam classifier!

**Link to work:** : NaN

## Day 9 : July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Revised my ML notes on regression, classification.

**Thoughts** : My college are going to start from monday, so I gotta implement my new schedule to work in effective way!

**Link to work:** : NaN

## Day 10 : July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Started learning NLP! Learned about nltk tokenizers, corpus, lexicons.

**Thoughts** : This domain is awesome, I'll dive more deeper in this and # TODO soon will write a blog post! 

**Link to work:** : NaN

## Day 11 : July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Did NLP basics viz, tokenization, stemming, TF-IDF and some sklearn viz CountVectorization, pipeline etc!

**Thoughts** : Now will dive deeper in NLP, I wish to do sentiment analysing using nltk soon!
